# ActWithFlags

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/act_with_flags.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/act_with_flags)

Required by key.matiq.

Handles booleans in "flags".
Defines setters and getters to access the booleans.


## Installation

As usual:
```ruby
# Gemfile
...
gem 'act_with_flags'
```

or manually:
```shell
$ gem install act_with_flags
```


## Version 3.x

As required by key.matiq an enhanced "origin:" has been implemented.
Act_with_flags now supports many "origin:"s
(not just renaming the default "flags").

An example:

```ruby
Order.add_to_flags :a # origin is :flags
Order.add_to_flags :b, b2: 63 # origin is :flags
Order.add_to_flags :c, origin: :origin1
Order.add_to_flags d: 3, origin: :origin2
Order.add_to_flags :d2, origin: :origin2
```

The default "origin:" continues to be "flags".

The option ":max_bits" is deprecated.
